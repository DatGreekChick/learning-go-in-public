# Day 14: Began Reading Effective Go

**Date**: 30 June 2023

## What I Did

### [Effective Go]

Disclaimer: as per the documentation, it's pretty outdated for modern Go
because it largely hasn't been updated since 2009 for Go's initial release.

#### Formatting

While I've been learning Go I've really hated the tabs situation. I also detest
when comments / types / properties / etc. are aligned by spaces. Seems like
such a waste of tooling and doesn't really do much in terms of readability in
my opinion. However, it's important to learn and accept the syntax and nuances
in any language, so I can appreciate its consistency.

I also love that `gofmt` is built-in. That makes formatting integrated to the
language and much easier to get started. Again, this allows for consistency no
matter who's writing the code. That's actually pretty significant and a nice
feature of the language.

#### Finished for

Next section is switch.

## Limited Comments

I'm writing this in my notes app at the moment because I've been in a car for
some of the day, and moving for the rest. A lot of these sections are mainly
review, though I wasn't aware that the formatting wasn't recommended to be
configured to preference.

Anyway I don't think I'll get home before my commit deadline, but I'll be
posting this word for word with proof of the last edit date and time of my
note. As I've given myself 24 hours after the deadline to push a commit, any
claims for June 30 will be denied.

Here's the proof:

Note: I mistakenly named it Day 13, but it was really Day 14.
