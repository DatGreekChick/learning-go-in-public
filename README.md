# Learning Go (In Public!)

![go badge] ![postgres badge]

## What is this repository? What are you doing?

I'm challenging myself to learn some Go in 30 days. I will be posting every day
in this repository explaining what I did that day in order to begin my Go
journey and advance my knowledge in the language!

Go is a language I've been interested in for a few years but haven't had the
opportunity to work with yet. I'm not sure how helpful this will be long-term,
but I'm always excited to gain a new skill!

## Why are you doing this?

I love learning new programming languages and learning in general! I have other
languages that I'd like to dive into more, so if this format works for me, I'll
spin off new repositories with different languages that interest me!

I chose Go as the first language in this potential future series because I've
been hearing such great things about it online and at work. I wanted to see
what all the fuss is about! ðŸ˜„

## How long are you doing this?

I'll be doing this for 30 days! I chose 30 days so that I can test out [GoLand]
under the 30-day free trial. I'm also basing this repository off this [format]
from [@TomLisankie]. I found this idea from my friend and former coworker
[@alaq] who did this for [clojure].

## How can I track your progress?

I'll post progress on this `README` right [here]! Follow the topic links to see
a breakdown of what I've done and learned that day. I'll be posting links to
the code I write in there as well, but you can access all of that in the [code]
directory.

## What if you miss a day?

I want to hold myself accountable, so if I miss a day I'll send over $5 to up
to five people for each missed day. If only one person claims this, I'll send
over a remaining $20 to that person!

## How can I claim my $5?

In order to claim the $5, please contact me via my [website contact form]. I'll
be sending over the money via Venmo.

Here are the terms:

- I'll be using Eastern Standard Time
- Each post must land to my GitHub repository within a 24-hour period
  - The 24-hour period ends at 11.59pm ET the _following_ day
- All claims expire 48-hours after the deadline

## What are you using to learn?

I'm using [Go's documentation]! My goal is to complete the guided learning
journeys on their website as well as some of their tutorials. I'll give
in-depth breakdowns of what I've done that day to make forward progress.

## Progress

Let's GO!
